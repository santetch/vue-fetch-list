# vue-fetch-list

This proyect is made in order to fetch some [API](https://swapi.dev/documentation) and display a list of planets.

Made with Vue.JS for the frontend to reutilize some compenents. But also not just staying there, probably for this example a bit overkill. The idea is to also create a workflow of information starting from the users action, following whatever the system needs to fullfil the users need from an Outside-In persperctive.

## Commands

```
    - npm install

    - npm run start

    - npm run build
```
